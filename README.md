## Caching Strategy

Used: `Redis`


1. A running server that can be accessed on http://localhost:8080/ hosting the endpoints
from Part 1 & 2 (feel free to use 3rd party libraries). The application should be written in
Node.js/ Golang/ TypeScript. Please share your work through Github.
2. Well tested code through unit tests
3. Elaboration on your caching strategy in Part 1
4. API keys/ secrets should not be stored in the code, please send us a file separately in your
email submission
5. Your project should contain a README.md with instructions on how to
- install dependencies
- use any config file or environment variables to run your application
- build and run your application
